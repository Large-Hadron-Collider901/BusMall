# **Busmall Project**
By: Skye McCullough


## Lab 11 Requirements - Complete

* Display three unique products by chance so that the viewers can pick a favorite.
* Create an algorithm that will randomly generate three unique product images from the images directory and display them side-by-side-by-side in the browser window.
* For each of the three images, increment its property of times it has been shown by one.
* Attach an event listener to the section of the HTML page where the images are going to be displayed.
* Once the users ‘clicks’ a product, generate three new products for the user to pick from. 
* Track the selections made by viewers so that I can determine which products to keep for the catalog. 
*  Define a property to hold the number of times a product has been clicked.
* After every selection by the viewer, update the newly added property to reflect if it was clicked.
* The user should be presented with 5 rounds of voting before ending the session. 
* Keep the number of rounds in a variable to allow the number to be easily changed for debugging and testing purposes.
* Create a property attached to the constructor function itself that keeps track of all the products that are currently being considered.
* After voting rounds have been completed, remove the event listeners on the product.
* Add a button with the text View Results, which when clicked displays the list of all the products followed by the votes received, and number of times seen for each. 


## Lab 12 Requirements - Complete
* Update your algorithm to randomly generate three unique product images from the images directory.
* Update your algorithm so that new products are generated, confirm that these products are not duplicates from the immediate previous set.
* Using ChartJS (imported from CDN), display the vote totals and the number of times a product was viewed in a bar chart format.
* Place the bar chart in the section located beneath your three product images
* The bar charts should only appear after all voting data has been collected.
